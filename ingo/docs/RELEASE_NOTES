The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H4 (2.0.8).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both server-side
(Sieve, Procmail, Maildrop) and client-side (IMAP) message filtering. For more
information on Ingo, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/ingo.

The major changes compared to the Ingo version H4 (2.0.7) are:
    * Fixed folder names in Procmail rules if using Maildir.
    * Updated Hungarian, Italian, and Swedish translations.
    * Small bugfixes.
